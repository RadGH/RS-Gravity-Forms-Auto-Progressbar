## Description

By default, Gravity Forms can show a progress bar on your form to indicate which "step" you are on. It's based on the current page and requires you to use more than one page.

This plugin changes the progress bar so that it automatically updates the percentage as you fill in different fields.

It's helpful for long forms where you want to give the user an idea of how much they have left to fill out.

_There are no settings for this plugin, you simply need to activate it._
